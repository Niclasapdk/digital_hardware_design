Non-clocked latch  
The latch top_traffic_design_i/top_0/U0/cnt_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin top_traffic_design_i/top_0/U0/cnt_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch top_traffic_design_i/top_0/U0/cnt_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin top_traffic_design_i/top_0/U0/cnt_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
